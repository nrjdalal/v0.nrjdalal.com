[<p className="flex gap-1 text-xl font-semibold">Next.js (Full-stack React Framework)<ArrowUpRight className="mt-0.5 h-4 w-4 text-blue-600" /></p>](https://nextjs.org/)

> The first thing I'd recommend is to get aquianted with **Next.js**

- Why Next.js? Because it's The React Framework for the Web.
- Used by some of the world's largest companies, Next.js enables you to create full-stack Web applications by extending the latest React features, and integrating powerful Rust-based JavaScript tooling for the fastest builds.
- And even React documentation recommends it first before anything else. Don't believe me? See for yourself:

[<p className="flex gap-1 text-xl font-semibold">Bun (An all-in-one JavaScript runtime)<ArrowUpRight className="mt-0.5 h-4 w-4 text-blue-600" /></p>](https://bun.sh/)

> Make a switch from Node.js to **Bun**, or **pnpm**

- Why Bun? Why not Node.js? Because Bun is the future.
- Besides being a runtime, Bun is a toolkit designed for speed, complete with a bundler, test runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager.
- Elegant APIs. Bun provides a minimal set of highly-optimimized APIs for performing common tasks, like starting an HTTP server and writing files.
- Bun is designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It natively implements hundreds of Node.js and Web APIs, including fs, path, Buffer and more.
- The goal of Bun is to run most of the world's server-side JavaScript and provide tools to improve performance, reduce complexity, and multiply developer productivity.

### What else?

Now that we have the runtime and full-stack framework, let's get to the fun part.

> CSS is bothering me. What should I do?

Use **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

> Do I need any UI libraries?

Just **shadcn/ui**, beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source. Though it's your choice, don't spend too much time on searching UI libraries.

> I need icons. Where do I get them?

Use **Lucide Icons**, beautiful & consistent icons. Made by the community.

> Forms are hard. How do I make them easier?

Use **React Hook Form**, performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

> What about state management?

Toss out that granular state management, manual refetching and endless bowls of async-spaghetti code. **TanStack Query** gives you declarative, always-up-to-date auto-managed queries and mutations that directly improve both your developer and user experiences. If needs to be whole app, you can also use **Jotai**,an atomic approach to global React state management.

> Which database should I use?

I'd recommend using **PostgreSQL**. It would fit most of your needs. If not give **MongoDB** a try.

> How do I interact with the database?

Go **Drizzle**, a TypeScript ORM that is lightweight, and production ready. With zero dependencies, and no code generation, Drizzle is the simplest way to interact with PostgreSQL and other databases.

> Authentication is giving me a headache. What should I do?

If we are using Next.js, we can use **NextAuth.js**. It is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications.

> How do I ensure type safety?

Use **Zod**, TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.

> Where can I host my application?

I'd recommend using **Vercel**. Vercelâ€™s Frontend Cloud provides the developer experience and infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized Web.
