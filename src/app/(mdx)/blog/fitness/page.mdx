### Pretext

For the past year, my lifestyle was too sedentary and I did accumulate over 107+ kg. I was not happy with my body, health, energy levels and overall well-being. I was not able to do things I wanted to do, and I was not able to do things I needed to do.

> Losing about 7 kgs during last December was a good start, and let's see how far I can go this year.

### Weight loss journey

> My goal here is to lose 15 kgs starting 01 Jan, over next two-three months, and bounce back with muscles while I am at it.

### Rules of the game

Will start slow and build up the momentum. I will be following a few rules to keep myself in check.

- 30 mins of cardio
- No eating after 8 PM
- Try to avoid processed food as much as possible
- Working out atleast 5 days a week (6 days a week is the goal)
- 45 mins of strength training (timing to be increased as I progress)
