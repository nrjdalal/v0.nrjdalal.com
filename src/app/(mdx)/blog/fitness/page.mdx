# Fitness in 2024

My fitness journey, what I&apos;ve learned and what I&apos;ve done

<br />

### Weight loss journey

For the past year, my lifestyle was too sedentary and I did accumulate over 107+ kg.

> My goal here is to lose 15 kgs (from 100 kgs) over next two-three months, and bounce back with muscles while I am at it.
