In this blog post, we will explore a way to enhance your npm and npx commands by conditionally using `bun` if it is installed. This can provide a faster and more efficient package management experience. We'll go through a simple shell script that achieves this and explain how it works.

## Overview

Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime that includes a fast package manager. By conditionally using `bun` for npm and npx commands, we can take advantage of its speed improvements. The shell script provided below checks if `bun` is installed and then modifies the behavior of npm and npx commands accordingly.

## The Shell Script

Here is the shell script that enhances npm and npx commands:

```sh
if command -v bun &>/dev/null; then
  npm() {
    if [[ "$*" == *"--real"* ]] || [[ -n "$USE_REAL_NPM" ]]; then
      export USE_REAL_NPM=1
      trap 'unset USE_REAL_NPM' EXIT
      command npm "${@/--real/}"
    else
      bun "$@"
    fi
  }
  npx() {
    if [[ "$*" == *"--real"* ]] || [[ -n "$USE_REAL_NPX" ]]; then
      export USE_REAL_NPX=1
      trap 'unset USE_REAL_NPX' EXIT
      command npx "${@/--real/}"
    else
      bunx "$@"
    fi
  }
else
  npm() {
    command npm "$@"
  }
  npx() {
    command npx "$@"
  }
fi
```

## How It Works

Let's break down how this script works:

1. **Checking for Bun**:

First, the script checks if `bun` is installed on your system by using the command `command -v bun &>/dev/null`. If `bun` is found, it proceeds to redefine the `npm` and `npx` commands.

2. **Redefining npm and npx**:

- **Custom `npm` Function**: The script creates a new `npm` function. This function first checks if the command being run contains `--real` or if the `USE_REAL_NPM` environment variable is set.
  - If `--real` is present or `USE_REAL_NPM` is set, it temporarily sets the `USE_REAL_NPM` variable, installs a `trap` to unset this variable upon exit, and then calls the original `npm` command by removing the `--real` flag from the arguments.
  - If `--real` is not present, it uses `bun` to execute the command.
- **Custom `npx` Function**: Similarly, a new `npx` function is defined. It follows the same logic as the `npm` function but uses `bunx` instead of `bun` to execute the command.

3. **Fallback to Original Commands**:

If `bun` is not installed, the script simply defines the `npm` and `npx` functions to call the original commands without any modification.

## Usage

To use this script, you can add it to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.profile`). This will ensure that the modified `npm` and `npx` commands are available in your terminal sessions.

```sh
if command -v bun &>/dev/null; then
  npm() {
    if [[ "$*" == *"--real"* ]] || [[ -n "$USE_REAL_NPM" ]]; then
      export USE_REAL_NPM=1
      trap 'unset USE_REAL_NPM' EXIT
      command npm "${@/--real/}"
    else
      bun "$@"
    fi
  }
  npx() {
    if [[ "$*" == *"--real"* ]] || [[ -n "$USE_REAL_NPX" ]]; then
      export USE_REAL_NPX=1
      trap 'unset USE_REAL_NPX' EXIT
      command npx "${@/--real/}"
    else
      bunx "$@"
    fi
  }
else
  npm() {
    command npm "$@"
  }
  npx() {
    command npx "$@"
  }
fi
```

After adding the script, restart your terminal or source the configuration file to apply the changes:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc  # or appropriate file for your shell
```

## Conclusion

By using this simple shell script, you can enhance your npm and npx commands to take advantage of `bun` if it is installed. This can lead to faster package management and a more efficient development workflow. Give it a try and see how it improves your experience!
