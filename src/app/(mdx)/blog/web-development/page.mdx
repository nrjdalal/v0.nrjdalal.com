> Starting in 2024? It has never been easier! The web is a great place to be, and it's only getting better.

## Prerequisites

- VS Code (Awesome code editor)
- Bun (An all-in-one JavaScript runtime) or Node.js

## Getting started with HTML

### What is HTML?

---

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

#### A simple HTML document

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is my first webpage!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
- The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page
- The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page
- The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
- The `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- The `<h1>` element defines a large heading

### How to run a HTML file locally? (Best way)

---

1. #### Open VS Code and create a new file called `index.html` in a new folder called `learning-html`.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is my first webpage!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

2. #### In terminal, navigate to the `learning-html` folder and run `bunx vite` to run a local server. The following should be displayed -

```
VITE v5.0.0  ready in 50 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h + enter to show help
```

3. #### Open the link in your browser. The following should be displayed -

<BrowserPreview title="My First Webpage" url="localhost:5173">
  <h1>This is my first webpage!</h1>
</BrowserPreview>
