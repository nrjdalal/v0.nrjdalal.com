### Prerequisites

- VS Code (Awesome code editor)
- Bun (An all-in-one JavaScript runtime) or Node.js

### Getting started with HTML

1. #### Open VS Code and create a new file called `index.html` in a new folder called `learning-html`.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

2. #### In terminal, navigate to the `learning-html` folder and run `bunx vite` to run a local server. The following should be displayed:

```
VITE v5.0.0  ready in 50 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h + enter to show help
```

3. #### Open the link in your browser. The following should be displayed:

<BrowserPreview title="My First Webpage" url="localhost:5173">
  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</BrowserPreview>

- The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

2. #### To view the webpage, run `bunx vite` in the terminal, and open the link in your browser. The following should be displayed:
