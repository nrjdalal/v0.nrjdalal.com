> Starting in 2024? It has never been easier! The web is a great place to be, and it's only getting better.

### Prerequisites

- VS Code (Awesome code editor)
- Bun (An all-in-one JavaScript runtime) or Node.js

### Getting started

1. #### First you need to create new file called `index.html` and open it in VS Code, and paste the following code

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

- All HTML documents must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration.
- The `<html>` tag represents the root of an HTML document and is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the `<!DOCTYPE>` tag).
- The `<head>` element is a container for metadata (data about data). Typically defines the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
- The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

2. #### To view the webpage, run `bunx vite` in the terminal, and open the link in your browser. The following should be displayed:

<BrowserPreview title="My First Webpage" url="http://localhost:5173">
  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</BrowserPreview>
