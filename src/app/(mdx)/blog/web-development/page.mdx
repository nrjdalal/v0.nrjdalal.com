> Starting in 2024? It has never been easier! The web is a great place to be, and it's only getting better.

### Prerequisites

- VS Code (Awesome code editor)
- Bun (An all-in-one JavaScript runtime) or Node.js

### Getting started

1. First you need to create new file called `index.html` and open it in VS Code, and paste the following code

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

> All HTML documents must start with a \<!DOCTYPE> declaration. Then the HTML document itself begins with \<html> and ends with \</html>. The visible part of the HTML document is between \<body> and \</body>.

2. To view the webpage, run `bunx vite` in the terminal, and open the link in your browser. The following should be displayed:

# Hello world!
