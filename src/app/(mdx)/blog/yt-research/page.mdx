## How YouTube works

- Browse and suggested is how users find most of their content.
- Hooks are the most important part of the video, it is what makes or breaks the video.
  - The first 7-15 seconds of the video, the less the better.
  - Validate the video and open up new unanswered questions.
- Create a good script, if the script is good, it doesn't matter how you have filmed the video, an iPhone would do (it is the lowest common denominator).
- Shorts are a good way to get discovered, they are a good way to get people to your channel.
- YouTube rewards longer watchtime, so if you can get people to watch longer videos, it is better.
  - Believe in your content and don't be afraid to put in longer videos, if the thumbnail, title, content are good, people will watch it. The top creators are making longer videos, 15-30 minutes long.
  - Mostly podcast centeric viewers will consume content for even longer duration, if you're catering to that audience, you can make even longer videos.

## What to do

- Performe a niche analysis and choose a value prop i.e. what is the unique value you are providing to your audience, that they can't get anywhere else.

- IEA (Identity, Emotion, Action) <br/>

  Identity - Who is the audience? <br/>
  Emotion - What do you want them to feel? <br/>
  Action - What do you want them to do? <br/>

  | Identity        | Emotion     | Action      |
  | --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Casual Chef     | Entertained | Subscribe   |
  | College Student | Educated    | Cook a meal |

- Create idea bank (AI can be used to generate ideas) - ideas are titles that can be explored (write 5-10 ideas a day if possible).

- Find a testing ground (a place to test your ideas) - talk to people, communities, etc. and see how they react and respond to your ideas, some more ways -

  - Create shorts to test, then create long form content.
  - Tests can be done on other platforms like X, Subreddits, Discord communities, etc. <br/>

    e.g. there was this question in subreddit recently, "What happened to all the big YouTube cooking channels? Why is there a massive decline in quality content or content in general?" <br/>

    Via this, ideas like why not interview someone from such a channel and ask them about it.
