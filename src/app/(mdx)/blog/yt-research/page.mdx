### How YouTube works

- Browse and suggested is how users find most of their content

### What to do

- Performe a niche analysis and choose a value prop i.e. what is the unique value you are providing to your audience, that they can't get anywhere else

- IEA (Identity, Emotion, Action) <br/><br/>
  Identity - Who is the audience? <br/>
  Emotion - What do you want them to feel? <br/>
  Action - What do you want them to do? <br/>

  | Identity        | Emotion     | Action      |
  | --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Casual Chef     | Entertained | Subscribe   |
  | College Student | Educated    | Cook a meal |

- Create idea bank (AI can be used to generate ideas) - ideas are titles that can be explored (write 5-10 ideas a day if possible)

- Find a testing ground (a place to test your ideas) - talk to people, communities, etc. and see how they react and respond to your ideas, some more ways -

  - Create shorts to test, then create long form content
