1. Always install `prettier` or similar code formatter to maintain consistent code style across the project.

   - If using `tailwindcss`, install `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` as dev dependency to automatically sort classes. It is created by `tailwindcss` aka `tailwindlabs` team.
   - Ordering of import statements might not look to be required, but it is a good practice to maintain consistency across the project. It is also easier to find a specific import when they are sorted alphabetically. This can be easily achieved by using `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`.
